# StarkMinds-SmartContracts

StarkMinds-SmartContracts is the dedicated repository for all Stellar smart contracts powering StarkMindsâ€”a pioneering blockchain education platform built on Stellar. Developed using Soroban, these smart contracts handle on-chain interactions such as course credentialing, token management, and secure data validation.

## Features

- Smart contract development using Soroban on Stellar
- Secure, efficient on-chain logic for education and credentialing
- Comprehensive testing suite for contract functionality
- Modular and scalable design for future enhancements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)
- [Stellar CLI & Soroban CLI](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started)
- Docker (optional, for running a local Stellar testnet)
- Required environment variable:  
  - `STELLAR_SECRET_KEY` (your Stellar secret key for deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/starkminds-smartcontracts.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Repository:**
   ```bash
   cd starkminds-smartcontracts
   ```
3. **Build the Smart Contracts:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

### Testing

Run tests to ensure everything is functioning as expected:
```bash
cargo test
```

### Linting and Formatting

To maintain code quality and consistency, run the following commands locally before committing:

- **Format code:**
  ```bash
  cargo fmt
  ```

- **Check for linting issues:**
  ```bash
  cargo clippy
  ```

These checks are also enforced in CI and will fail the build if there are formatting issues or warnings.

## Deployment

The repository includes enhanced deployment scripts for deploying Soroban smart contracts to Stellar's testnet and mainnet.  

Scripts:  
- `scripts/deploy_testnet.sh`  
- `scripts/deploy_mainnet.sh`  

These scripts include safety features, argument parsing, environment validation, dependency checks, and dry-run support.

### Before Deploying

1. Ensure contracts are built and optimized:  
   ```bash
   cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```
2. Set `STELLAR_SECRET_KEY` in your environment:  
   ```bash
   export STELLAR_SECRET_KEY='your_secret_key_here'
   ```
3. Optionally set `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` for a custom RPC endpoint.  

The scripts automatically validate:  
- Installed tools: `soroban`, `stellar`, `jq`  
- Environment variables: `STELLAR_SECRET_KEY`  
- Presence of optimized WASM files in:  
  ```
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/*.optimized.wasm
  ```

### Script Usage

Run the scripts from the project root:

- **Testnet Deployment**  
  ```bash
  ./scripts/deploy_testnet.sh [OPTIONS]
  ```

- **Mainnet Deployment**  
  ```bash
  ./scripts/deploy_mainnet.sh [OPTIONS]
  ```

### Available Flags

| Flag                 | Description                                                                                  | Required | Default        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------|
| `--contract <name>`  | Deploy a specific contract (e.g., certificate). If omitted, deploys all contracts.           | No       | All contracts  |
| `--dry-run`          | Preview the deployment steps without executing any soroban commands. Useful for verification.| No       | Disabled       |
| `--profile <name>`   | Specify a Soroban profile (e.g., for AWS or custom config).                                   | No       | None           |
| `--verbose`          | Enable detailed output, including file paths and network details.                            | No       | Disabled       |
| `--help`             | Display usage information and exit.                                                          | No       | N/A            |

#### Notes:
- Mainnet deployment requires explicit confirmation by typing **YES** (in all caps).  
- In `--dry-run` mode, commands are echoed but not executed, and simulated contract IDs are generated.  
- Contract names must match the basename of your `.optimized.wasm` files (e.g., `certificate.optimized.wasm`).  

### Usage Examples

- Dry-run all contracts to testnet (preview only):  
  ```bash
  ./scripts/deploy_testnet.sh --dry-run
  ```

- Deploy a specific contract to testnet:  
  ```bash
  ./scripts/deploy_testnet.sh --contract certificate
  ```

- Verbose dry-run for a specific contract to mainnet:  
  ```bash
  ./scripts/deploy_mainnet.sh --contract certificate --dry-run --verbose
  ```

- Deploy all contracts to mainnet with a custom profile:  
  ```bash
  ./scripts/deploy_mainnet.sh --profile myprofile
  ```

After successful deployment, contract IDs are saved to:  
```
target/<contract_name>.<network>.id
```

For advanced configurations or troubleshooting, refer to the [Soroban documentation](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs).
